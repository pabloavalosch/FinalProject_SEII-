# FinalProject_SEII-
This project is going to send 4 frames from UART in different moments with a wished Duty Cycle value to be received from OSEK operating system and start a PWM signal generated with this Duty Cycle.

NOTE: At the end OSEK was not implemented. On branch FreeRTOS_TX is the transmission code for K64 and main has the FreeRTOS_RX with the reception code for K66.
